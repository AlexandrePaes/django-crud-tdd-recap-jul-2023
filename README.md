# django-crud-tdd-recap-jul-2023
This project is a aim to start simple but get some upgrades like full CI/CD with automated tests also then replicated on Gitlab to learn more about the pros and cons of working with Github or Gitlab for DevOps/DevSecOps purposes. I'm thinking also about dockers and other tools to use in this project but I'm not sure if it will be worthy or not yet
